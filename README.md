# Basic Calculator App

## Project Description
This is a simple Django web application that functions as a basic calculator. The app allows users to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on up to four numbers. It includes input validation and error handling for division by zero and non-numeric inputs.

## Features
- A homepage with a form to input up to 4 numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Sequential calculation of numbers based on the selected operation.
- User input validation to ensure numbers are entered and division by zero is prevented.
- Basic HTML and CSS for styling the form and displaying results.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

### URLs
- `/` : The homepage with the calculator form.
- `/calculate/` : Endpoint that processes the calculation and returns the result.
